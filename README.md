Hello! Welcome to (half of) the repo for my Flatiron School final project, Daily Diary.

This project was built over 3 weeks with React & Material UI on the Front End (this repo) and Rails API on the backend. It includes Authorization using JWT tokens.

The goal of this project is to make keeping a daily diary easier and share aggregate data on the user's diary (number of posts, and emoji mood board).

You can view a demo of this project here: http://youtu.be/NPyTnGu1Hpg?hd=1
